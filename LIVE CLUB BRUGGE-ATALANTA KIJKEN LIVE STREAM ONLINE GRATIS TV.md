How to watch the Champions League match between Club Bruges and Atalanta, as well as kick-off time and team news.

Club Brugge came dangerously close to missing out on a spot in the top 24 of the UEFA Champions League league phase but narrowly secured their place ahead of a showdown with Serie A title contenders Atalanta this week.

Despite suffering a 3-1 defeat at the hands of Manchester City in their last European outing, Brugge will back themselves to go toe-to-toe with their Italian counterparts. Their fluid defensive setup, which quickly shifts shape upon losing possession in the oppositionâ€™s half, has been a key feature of their play. Their aggressive use of the flanksâ€”especially in rapid transitionsâ€”makes for an exciting, high-tempo style of football.

Meanwhile, Atalanta fell just short of an automatic berth in the last 16, finishing a point shy after a dramatic 2-2 draw with Barcelona on the final matchday of the league phase. The visitors have been a force to reckon with on the road, losing just once in their last 15 away fixtures. They head into this encounter brimming with confidence, having hammered Verona 5-0 over the weekend in a commanding warm-up performance.
